## 🧩 How to Install the Extension (from the dist folder)

Since this extension isn’t on the Chrome Web Store yet, you’ll need to install it manually.
It’s quick and safe — no special permissions required.

### 1️⃣ Download the dist.zip file

Get the ZIP file I sent you (it’s the built version of the extension).

Unzip it — you’ll get a folder named dist.

### 2️⃣ Open Chrome Extensions Page

Open Chrome and go to
👉 chrome://extensions

In the top right corner, turn on Developer mode.

### 3️⃣ Load the Extension

Click “Load unpacked”.

Select the dist folder (not the ZIP file).

### 4️⃣ Done!

You’ll now see the extension icon appear in the Chrome toolbar.

Click the puzzle icon 🧩 → Pin it for quick access.

### 5️⃣ Optional: Update Later

If I send you a new version, just:

Delete the old one from chrome://extensions

Load the new dist folder again
